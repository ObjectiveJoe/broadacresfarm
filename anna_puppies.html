    Hunter is always by my side when I work cows at the farm. 
    He is brave, and loyal, and loves to help me work the cows.
    He is absolutely fearless and always has my back when I am around our  bulls.
    He is a working dog who came to our farm when he was about 8 weeks old. 
    He is 5 years old now and I couldn't run my cows without him.

    Anna is his girlfriend. Anna is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNab_dog">McNab Shepherd</a>.
    Hunter is a mix of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNab_dog">McNab Shepherd</a> and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cattle_Dog">Red Heeler </a>. 
    Anna and Hunter are both mid sized dogs, about 40-45 lbs. 
    Both Anna and Hunter are very affectionate. 
    They both also get along well with cats and display gaurdian dog traits.
</p>

<p> These puppies were born August 1st, 2024 and will be ready to go to their new homes around September 28th. 
    Three are females and 8 are males. One of the smaller males has spots and coloring like a Blue Heeler. 
    A few are black with a little white. A few are white with a small spot or two. Many look like Panda Bears and are very adorable.

    These puppies are for sale. It is important due to their breed that they go to homes where they will be integrated into the family.
    Also, it is important that they go to homes where there is room for them to run and members of the home are active and want to do things with the dogs.
    For instance, these dogs are excellant companions and like to go for 2-3 walks a day. 
    They will gladly be at the door waiting for you to get your shoes and gladly accompany you.
