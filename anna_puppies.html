    Hunter is always by my side when I work cows at the farm. 
    He is brave, and loyal, and loves to help me work the cows.
    He is absolutely fearless and always has my back when I am around our  bulls.
    He is a working dog who came to our farm when he was about 8 weeks old. 
    He is 5 years old now and I couldn't run my cows without him.

    These puppies are for sale. It is important due to their breed that they go to homes where they will be integrated into the family.
    Also, it is important that they go to homes where there is room for them to run and members of the home are active and want to do things with the dogs.
    For instance, these dogs are excellant companions and like to go for 2-3 walks a day. 
    They are good at tellng time, and will be at the door waiting for you to get your shoes and gladly accompany you.
